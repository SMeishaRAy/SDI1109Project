			<h2>Project 3 - The Chocolate Exchange</h2>
			<p>Today I was looking through one of my kitchen cabinets and found a variety of different types of chocolates. I remembered seeing a commercial on television about a place called “The Chocolate Exchange” and thought what a great idea. With all of these different types of chocolates I have, I could go and exchange them for different types of chocolate. </p>
